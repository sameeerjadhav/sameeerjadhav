I hold a Master of Science in Computer Science with a specialization in Data Science from the College of Engineering and Applied Sciences at the University of Cincinnati (UC), Cincinnati, Ohio. My academic journey was marked by in-depth exploration and research, particularly in the field of Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) based assistive robot control. Additionally, I achieved a Bachelor of Engineering in Information Technology from Atharva College of Engineering, University of Mumbai, India.

### **Technical Prowess: Skills that Drive Innovation**

My technical toolkit is well-equipped to handle a myriad of challenges. Proficient in programming and scripting languages such as Python, R, and SQL, I leverage my skills to develop comprehensive solutions. I am well-versed in tools like Microsoft Azure, Power BI, Tableau, PyCharm, and Microsoft SQL Server, among others. My skills span across Machine Learning, Deep Learning, MLOps, Statistical Modeling, Predictive Modeling, and Automation. I am comfortable working with Big Data, Hadoop, Cloud Computing, structured and unstructured databases, and time-series modeling. Frameworks such as NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Keras, OpenCV, PyTorch, R Shiny, Koalas, and Streamlit form the foundation of my technical arsenal.

### **Professional Journey: Transforming Data into Insights**

My career path reflects my commitment to harnessing data for actionable insights. As a Data Science Research Intern at Procter & Gamble Digital Accelerator at UC, Cincinnati, Ohio, I am engaged in groundbreaking work. I am developing an Evidential Deep Learning model on diverse multi-dimensional data to predict the success rate of critical studies. This model empowers early identification of potential product quality issues, leading to proactive remediation strategies. I have also been entrusted with implementing Procter & Gambleâ€™s native frameworks for Evidential Deep Learning, showcasing my expertise in understanding and adapting to cutting-edge technologies.

Furthermore, I have spearheaded the creation of a scalable image analytics pipeline on Azure Data Factory, facilitating product designers at P&G in their research endeavors. My proficiency with Azure Databricks and Azure Blob Storage enables me to distill large-scale structured and unstructured data into meaningful insights. My secure data visualization solutions, crafted using Power BI and Streamlit, empower stakeholders to glean insights from Databricks and Azure Blob Storage, amplifying the impact of data-driven decisions.

### **A Proven Record of Delivering Value**

During my tenure as an Application Development Analyst at Accenture in Mumbai, India, I exhibited my analytical prowess by identifying potentially fraudulent claims with higher accuracy than the legacy system. Collaborating across teams, I implemented advanced anomaly detection techniques for credit card transactions, significantly enhancing fraud detection capabilities. My contributions extended to automating reserve prediction and optimizing claim processing efficiency by 10%, earning me the prestigious Accenture Excellence Award for delivering substantial value to clients' businesses.

### **Academic Ventures: Translating Ideas into Reality**

My passion for innovation is evident through my academic projects. The "Sign Speller," an English to Sign Language translator, stands out as a testament to my commitment to inclusivity. This project not only secured the "Best Education Hack" award at the RevolutionUC Hackathon but also showcases my dedication to leveraging technology for social good. Another noteworthy endeavor is the "Wafer Sensor Fault Detection" project, which saw the creation of a multi-model classification framework for predicting wafer sensor quality. My proficiency in building end-to-end pipelines for automation and machine learning played a pivotal role in the success of this venture.

### **Certifications and Achievements: A Trailblazer in the Field**

My continuous pursuit of knowledge is reflected in my certifications. I am an Azure Data Scientist (DP-100) and hold Azure Data Fundamentals (DP-900) certification. Additionally, I have completed the Neural Networks & Deep Learning course from DeepLearning.AI, further enhancing my expertise in cutting-edge technologies.

My commitment to excellence has been recognized through various awards and fellowships, totaling $39,427. Among these honors are the Graduate Incentive Award, CEAS Modeling and Simulation Fellowship, and Procter & Gamble Simulation Center Student accolade. Additionally, I clinched the second place in the 'UC Startup Competition,' where I showcased my entrepreneurial spirit by crafting a sustainable startup concept.

### **Conclusion: A Data Visionary with a Drive to Excel**
