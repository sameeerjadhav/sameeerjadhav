Welcome to my GitHub! Iâ€™m Sameer Jadhav, an AI Engineer driven by curiosity and impact.

Over the past few years, Iâ€™ve worked across healthcare, e-commerce, and enterprise domains applying machine learning, large language models, and MLOps to solve real-world problems. From reducing latency in production pipelines to building knowledge graphs for biomedical discovery, Iâ€™ve learned that great AI isnâ€™t just about models, itâ€™s about systems, outcomes, and empathy for the end user.

Currently at Mercato Fabbrica, Iâ€™m building a recommender system that helps people find products they love leveraging deep learning, personalization techniques, and scalable architecture.

Whether it's accelerating quality checks at Procter & Gamble, driving research innovation at Cincinnati Children's, or building robust ETL pipelines at Accenture, Iâ€™ve consistently worked at the intersection of data, domain, and product.

I thrive in teams where experimentation is encouraged, collaboration is real, and the goal is clear: use AI to build things that matter.
