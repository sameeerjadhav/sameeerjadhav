Welcome to my GitHub! I‚Äôm Sameer Jadhav, a data scientist with a passion for building scalable, data-driven solutions that make a real impact. Currently, I‚Äôm an AI Research Intern at Cincinnati Children‚Äôs Health and Medical Center, where I am building cutting-edge AI tools to transform healthcare research and clinical insights.

## üîç About Me

My journey in data science and AI spans several diverse domains, including healthcare, consumer goods, and insurance. I have extensive experience developing knowledge graphs, building multi-agent systems, engineering deep learning models for image and signal processing, and optimizing predictive algorithms. My technical skills are broad and deep, covering everything from statistical modeling and natural language processing to deploying production-grade applications on cloud platforms.

### Highlights of My Work

- **Knowledge Graphs and AI Systems for Healthcare**  
  At Cincinnati Children's, I am leading the development of a knowledge graph-powered, multi-agent Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system. This system uses GenAI techniques like instruction fine-tuning and vector search, enabling researchers to derive insights faster and more accurately from scientific data.

- **Advanced Image Analytics in Consumer Goods**  
  During my time with Procter & Gamble, I built image segmentation pipelines using deep learning models (ResNet, U-Net) on Azure Data Factory to streamline high-volume data processing, providing product designers with insights that enhance pre-market product quality and consumer satisfaction.

- **Insurance Technology Solutions**  
  At Accenture, I worked as an Application Development Analyst, transforming the Duck Creek Claims process. I engineered automation processes that improved data integrity, reduced data transmission errors, and optimized claim processing speed by 93%, earning me the Accenture Excellence Award.

### Featured Projects

- **Healthpedia AI: Your Wellness Companion**  
  Healthpedia is an LLM-powered medical chatbot leveraging LangChain, Meta Llama2, and Pinecone, designed to answer complex healthcare-related queries with precision. By integrating advanced NLP techniques with RetrievalQA, it provides meaningful, context-aware responses for medical inquiries.

- **Sensor-Sentinel: ML-Powered Quality Assurance**  
  Developed a robust ML pipeline for quality assurance in wafer sensor manufacturing, utilizing KMeans clustering for segmentation and classification models (Random Forest, XGBoost) to ensure accurate and scalable sensor quality predictions.

## üîß Technical Skills

- **Languages**: Python, R, SQL
- **Tools & Platforms**: Microsoft Azure, Databricks, Neo4j, Power BI, Streamlit, MLFlow, Docker, Flask
- **Libraries & Frameworks**: TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-Learn, LangChain, Pinecone, SciPy, Pandas, NumPy
- **Certifications**: Microsoft Certified: Azure Data Scientist Associate (DP-100), Azure Data Fundamentals (DP-900), GenAI with Large Language Models

## üå± Areas of Interest

I‚Äôm passionate about applying AI to solve real-world problems, particularly in healthcare and consumer insights. My interests include:

- Large Language Models (LLMs) and Natural Language Processing
- Knowledge Graphs and Multi-Agent Systems
- Machine Learning Interpretability & Explainability
- Cloud & Scalable AI Deployments
- Image Segmentation & Computer Vision
